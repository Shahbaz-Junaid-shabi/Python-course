 # ****************** Modules in Python ******
'''
In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library 
or a file that contains a set of functions that you want to include in your
application.

 There are two types of modules 
 i) Build-in modules --> such as python already --> e.g -  freeze , garidar
 ii) External Modules ---> Do install the labriers such as
                                        * Pandas.
                                        * NumPy.
                                        * Keras.
                                        * TensorFlow.
                                        * Scikit Learn.
                                        * Eli5.
                                        * SciPy.
                                        * PyTorch.
                                        e.g----> milk,banana

'''

import pandas as pd
l = [1,2,3,4,5]
newvariable =pd.Series(l)
print(newvariable)
