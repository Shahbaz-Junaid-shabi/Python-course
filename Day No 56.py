# Object Oriented Programming 
'''

1. What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?

OOP is a way of organizing programs where properties (data) and behaviors (actions) are grouped together into objects.
Think of a program as an assembly line in a factory. At each step, a system component processes material, transforming it into a finished product.
An object represents a component on this assembly line. It contains both data (like raw materials) and behavior (like actions performed at each step).

2. Defining a Class: The Blueprint

A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.

For example, you can define a Person class with attributes like name, age, and address, along with methods like walk() and talk().

3. Creating Objects (Instances)

Once you have a class, you can create instances (objects) from it.
For instance, you can create a person1 object with specific values for its attributes: name = "Alice", age = 30, and address = "123 Main St".

4. Attributes and Methods
Attributes are the properties of an object. They store data.
Methods are the actions an object can perform. They define the behavior.
For example, a Car class might have attributes like make, model, and year, and methods like start_engine() and drive().

'''

'''
5. Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing one.
You can define a child class that inherits attributes and methods from a parent class.
For instance, a Student class can inherit from the Person class, adding specific attributes like student_id.
'''

'''
Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction
Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated uniformly. For example, both a Circle and a Rectangle can have a calculate_area() method.
Encapsulation: Hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only whatâ€™s necessary. Methods and attributes can be private or public.
Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on essential features. Users interact with high-level interfaces without needing to know implementation details.
