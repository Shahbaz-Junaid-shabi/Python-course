# *******  Variable , Datatypes and Concatenation *****

#      Variables :
#                Variables is containor which hold the data 
#                   a = 10 
#                The keyword are not allowed to make very variables 

#     Datatypes :
 
#  variables                            Datatypes         symbol in python 

#  a = 10                                 int                 int
#  b = True                               booleam             bool
#  c = " juanid "                         string              str         
#  d = None                               NoneType            None
#  e = array["HTLM","CSS","JS"]           arrays              arrays  this optional see next videos

# HTML stands for " Hypertext Markup Language"      
# CSS  stands for " Cascading Style Sheets "
# JS  stands for " Java Script "

# Numeric Data Types
#  --> int 
#  --> float
#  --> complex




# Concatenation : Mean combine the other code or string , number etc .
